# LeaMicheleBot
 
Fun little Discord bot that translates users messages from plain english into emojis, Lea Michele instagram style

## How to use

User can get the bot to translate their message with the !translate command e.g.:

If there is no existing translation for one or more words in the message, the bot will prompt the user to add them to it's dictionary:

User can then use the !add command to add words and their emoji translation:
